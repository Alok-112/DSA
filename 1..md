# Flowchart & Pseudocode  

## Why Study DSA (Data Structures and Algorithms)?  
- **Most tech companies** ask DSA questions in their coding rounds.  
- DSA is a fundamental part of **Software Engineering** interviews.  

### Why Do Companies Ask DSA Questions?  
- Companies focus on **problem-solving skills**.  
- The better your DSA concepts, the better you will be at solving real-world problems efficiently.  

> **Primary Work as a Software Engineer**: Solve problems **efficiently** and **optimally**.

**Important DSA Techniques**:  
- Dynamic Programming (DP)  
- Greedy Algorithms  
- Two-pointer Approach  

> **Tip**: Start learning DSA concepts with a programming language (e.g., **C++**).

## How to Solve a Problem  

### Example: Find the Sum of Two Numbers `a` and `b`  
1. **Understand** the problem.  
2. Define the **input**.  
3. Write the **solution**: `sum = a + b`.  
4. Write the **code**.

## Flowchart & Pseudocode  
- **Flowchart**: A visual diagram representing the solution.  
- **Pseudocode**: A general logic of the solution in plain text.

## Practice Problems  

For each problem below, write the **flowchart** and **pseudocode**.

### 1. Calculate the Area of a Square  
#### Pseudocode:  
```
Start  
Input: side_length  
Area = side_length * side_length  
Output: Area  
End  
```



---

### 2. Find the Minimum of Two Numbers  
#### Pseudocode:  
```
Start  
Input: a, b  
If (a < b)  
    Min = a  
Else  
    Min = b  
Output: Min  
End  
```

---

### 3. Check if a Number is Even or Odd  
#### Pseudocode:  
```
Start  
Input: num  
If (num % 2 == 0)  
    Output: "Even"  
Else  
    Output: "Odd"  
End  
```

---

### 4. Calculate the Sum of Numbers from 1 to N  
#### Pseudocode:  
```
Start  
Input: N  
Sum = 0  
For i = 1 to N  
    Sum = Sum + i  
Output: Sum  
End  
```

---

### 5. Check if a Number is Prime or Not  
#### Pseudocode:  
```
Start  
Input: num  
If num <= 1  
    Output: "Not Prime"  
Set isPrime = True  
For i = 2 to sqrt(num)  
    If (num % i == 0)  
        isPrime = False  
        Break  
If isPrime == True  
    Output: "Prime"  
Else  
    Output: "Not Prime"  
End  
```

## Homework  

For each of the following, write the **flowchart** and **pseudocode**:

1. **Calculate Simple Interest**  
   - Formula: `SI = (P * R * T) / 100`  
   - Input: Principal `P`, Rate `R`, Time `T`.  
   - Output: Simple Interest `SI`.  

2. **Find the Maximum of Two Numbers**  
   - Input: `a`, `b`.  
   - Output: Maximum of `a` and `b`.  

3. **Calculate Factorial of a Number N**  
   - Formula: `n! = 1 x 2 x 3 x ... x n`.  
   - Input: `N`.  
   - Output: Factorial of `N`.  

4. **Determine if a Person Can Get a Driving License**  
   - Condition: `age >= 18`.  
   - Input: `age`.  
   - Output: "Yes" (if eligible) or "No" (if not eligible).

## Example Code  

Hereâ€™s an example solution in **C++** for "Sum of Numbers from 1 to N":

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    int N, sum = 0;
    cout << "Enter a number: ";
    cin >> N;

    for (int i = 1; i <= N; ++i) {
        sum += i;
    }

    cout << "Sum of numbers from 1 to " << N << " is: " << sum << endl;
    return 0;
}
```

## Key Takeaways  
- The **stronger your basic concepts**, the easier it will be to tackle advanced topics.  
- Always approach a problem systematically: **Understand â†’ Input â†’ Solution â†’ Code**.  
- Write **flowcharts** and **pseudocode** for better clarity before coding.  

Happy Learning! ðŸš€
