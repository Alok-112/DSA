Flowchart & Pseudocode

Why study DSA?
Most of tech companies ask DSA question in thier coding rounds 
Software Engineering 

Why Companies ask DSA Questions?
They ask DSA questions because the better your DSA concepts are the better the problem solver you will be as a software engineer 

After going to a company major focus (Primary work) is on solving a problem 
Efficient and Optimally Solving a problem

Algorithms and approaches -> DP , Greedy Algo , Two pointer Approach

The stronger the basic concepts of ours the easy will be to tackle big concepts
DSA concepts need to be learned with the a language -> Take a language (C++)
