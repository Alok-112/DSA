# C++ Basics: Variables, Data Types, Type Casting, and Operators

C++ is a **case-sensitive** programming language that offers powerful features for variable management, type casting, and various operations using different types of operators.

## Variables and Data Types
Variables in C++ are used to store data, which can be of different types. Each variable must be declared with a specific data type before use. Common data types include:

- **Primitive Data Types**: `int`, `char`, `float`, `double`, `bool`
- **Derived Data Types**: `array`, `pointer`, `reference`
- **User-defined Data Types**: `struct`, `union`, `enum`, `class`

### Example Declaration:
```cpp
int age = 25;
char grade = 'A';
double price = 99.99;
bool isValid = true;
```

## Type Casting
Type casting is the process of converting a variable from one data type to another. There are two main types of type casting in C++:

### 1. Implicit Conversion
This type of conversion is done automatically by the compiler when a variable is assigned a value of a different but compatible type.

**Example:**
```cpp
char grade = 'a';
int value = grade;
std::cout << value << std::endl; // Output: 97 (ASCII value of 'a')
```

### 2. Explicit Casting
Explicit casting requires manual intervention by the programmer to convert a data type.

**Example:**
```cpp
double price = 100.99;
int newPrice = (int)price; // Alternatively: static_cast<int>(price)
std::cout << newPrice << std::endl; // Output: 100
```

## Input and Output in C++
The `cout` and `cin` are global objects used for output and input, respectively. They are not functions but are overloaded operators.

- **Output**: `std::cout << "Hello, World!" << std::endl;`
- **Input**: `std::cin >> variableName;`

**Example:**
```cpp
int n;
std::cout << "Enter a number: ";
std::cin >> n;
std::cout << "You entered: " << n << std::endl;
```

## Operators in C++
Operators in C++ are symbols that perform operations on variables and values. Below are the major categories of operators:

### 1. Arithmetic Operators
These operators perform basic mathematical operations:
- `+` (Addition)
- `-` (Subtraction)
- `*` (Multiplication)
- `/` (Division)
- `%` (Modulus)

**Example:**
```cpp
int a = 10, b = 3;
std::cout << "Sum: " << (a + b) << std::endl;
std::cout << "Modulus: " << (a % b) << std::endl; // Output: 1
```

### 2. Relational Operators
These operators compare two values and return `true` or `false`:
- `<`, `<=`, `>`, `>=`, `==`, `!=`

**Example:**
```cpp
if (a != b) {
    std::cout << "a is not equal to b" << std::endl;
}
```

### 3. Logical Operators
Logical operators are used to combine multiple conditions:
- `&&` (Logical AND)
- `||` (Logical OR)
- `!` (Logical NOT)

**Example:**
```cpp
if (a > b && b < 5) {
    std::cout << "Both conditions are true" << std::endl;
}
```

### 4. Bitwise Operators
Bitwise operators perform operations on bits and are useful for low-level programming:
- `&` (AND)
- `|` (OR)
- `^` (XOR)
- `~` (NOT)
- `<<` (Left Shift)
- `>>` (Right Shift)

**Example:**
```cpp
int x = 5; // Binary: 0101
int y = 3; // Binary: 0011
std::cout << "Bitwise AND: " << (x & y) << std::endl; // Output: 1 (0001)
```

### 5. Unary Operators
Unary operators operate on a single operand:
- `++` (Increment)
- `--` (Decrement)

**Example:**
```cpp
int counter = 5;
counter++; // Increment: counter = 6
counter--; // Decrement: counter = 5
```

### 6. Binary Operators
Binary operators work on two operands. Examples include all arithmetic and logical operators.

**Example:**
```cpp
int result = a + b; // Binary operator '+'
```

## Additional Tips:
- **Type Safety**: Prefer using `static_cast<type>(variable)` for explicit type conversions to ensure safer code practices.
- **End-of-Line Character**: Use `std::endl` or `'\n'` to print a newline.
- **Namespaces**: Use `std::` prefix or `using namespace std;` for simpler code.

### Example Code Block:
```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main() {
    double num1 = 45.6;
    int num2 = static_cast<int>(num1);

    std::cout << "Original double: " << num1 << std::endl;
    std::cout << "After explicit casting to int: " << num2 << std::endl;

    int a = 10, b = 3;
    if (a != b) {
        std::cout << "a is not equal to b" << std::endl;
    }

    return 0;
}
```
