# Conditional Statements and Loops in C++

This document provides an overview of **Conditional Statements** and **Loops** in C++ with clear examples. These concepts are fundamental to control the flow of a program.

## Conditional Statements

Conditional statements allow you to make decisions in your code based on conditions. Here are the primary types:

### 1. `if-else` Statement

Use the `if-else` statement to execute code blocks based on whether a condition is `true` or `false`.

```cpp
int n;
cin >> n;

if (n >= 0) {
    cout << "Positive" << endl;
} else {
    cout << "Negative" << endl;
}
```

### 2. `if-else if-else` Statement

Use `if-else if-else` for multiple conditions.

```cpp
int marks;
cin >> marks;

if (marks >= 90) {
    cout << "Grade: A" << endl;
} else if (marks >= 80 && marks < 90) {
    cout << "Grade: B" << endl;
} else {
    cout << "Grade: C" << endl;
}
```

### 3. Ternary Operator

The ternary operator is a compact way to write conditional statements.

```cpp
int age;
cin >> age;

string result = (age >= 18) ? "Eligible to Vote" : "Not Eligible to Vote";
cout << result << endl;
```

## Loops

Loops are used to execute a block of code repeatedly. Below are the common types of loops in C++.

### 1. `while` Loop

The `while` loop executes as long as the condition is `true`.

```cpp
int i = 1;

while (i <= 5) {
    cout << i << " ";
    i++;
}
```

**Output:**
```
1 2 3 4 5
```

### 2. `for` Loop

The `for` loop provides a concise way of writing loops with initialization, condition, and update all in one line.

```cpp
for (int i = 1; i <= 5; i++) {
    cout << i << " ";
}
```

**Output:**
```
1 2 3 4 5
```

### 3. Nested Loops

Nested loops are used when you need to iterate over a set of items inside another set. They are commonly used for printing patterns.

#### Example: Star Pattern

```cpp
int rows = 5;

for (int i = 1; i <= rows; i++) {
    for (int j = 1; j <= i; j++) {
        cout << "* ";
    }
    cout << endl;
}
```

**Output:**
```
* 
* * 
* * * 
* * * * 
* * * * * 
```

## Additional Topics

### Break and Continue

1. **`break` Statement**: Terminates the loop immediately.
   ```cpp
   for (int i = 1; i <= 10; i++) {
       if (i == 5) break;
       cout << i << " ";
   }
   ```
   **Output:**
   ```
   1 2 3 4
   ```

2. **`continue` Statement**: Skips the current iteration and moves to the next one.
   ```cpp
   for (int i = 1; i <= 5; i++) {
       if (i == 3) continue;
       cout << i << " ";
   }
   ```
   **Output:**
   ```
   1 2 4 5
   ```

---

### Do-While Loop

The `do-while` loop ensures the block of code runs at least once, even if the condition is false.

```cpp
int i = 1;

do {
    cout << i << " ";
    i++;
} while (i <= 5);
```

**Output:**
```
1 2 3 4 5
```

| Feature                 | Description                                                      |
|-------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `if-else`              | Executes a block of code based on a condition.                  |
| `if-else if-else`      | Handles multiple conditions.                                     |
| Ternary Operator        | Short form for simple conditions.                               |
| `while` Loop           | Repeats while the condition is `true`.                          |
| `for` Loop             | Compact loop with initialization, condition, and update.        |
| Nested Loops           | Loops inside another loop, useful for patterns.                 |
| `break` & `continue`   | Control loop execution (exit or skip iteration).                |
| `do-while` Loop        | Executes at least once before checking the condition.           |
