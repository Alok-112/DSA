# Binary Number System and Complements

### Number Systems Overview

- **Decimal (Base 10):** Uses digits 0–9 (10 digits). This is the system most humans use in everyday life.
- **Binary (Base 2):** Uses digits 0 and 1. Commonly used in digital electronics and computer systems.
- **Octal (Base 8):** Uses digits 0–7. Often used as a shorthand for binary in computing.
- **Hexadecimal (Base 16):** Uses digits 0–9 and letters A–F (16 symbols). Widely used for memory addresses and color codes in computing.

### Conversions

#### **Binary to Decimal**
To convert a binary number to decimal, multiply each binary digit by \(2^n\), where \(n\) is the position of the digit from the right (starting at 0).

**Example:**
Convert \(1010_2\) to decimal.
\[
(1010)_2 = (1 \times 2^3) + (0 \times 2^2) + (1 \times 2^1) + (0 \times 2^0) = 8 + 0 + 2 + 0 = 10_{10}
\]

#### **Decimal to Binary**
To convert a decimal number to binary, repeatedly divide the number by 2, recording the remainder, until the quotient is 0. The binary number is the remainders read from bottom to top.

**Example:**
Convert \(13_{10}\) to binary.

1. \(13 \div 2 = 6\), remainder \(1\)
2. \(6 \div 2 = 3\), remainder \(0\)
3. \(3 \div 2 = 1\), remainder \(1\)
4. \(1 \div 2 = 0\), remainder \(1\)

Reading remainders from bottom to top: \(13_{10} = 1101_2\).

### Complements

Complements are used for signed number representation and arithmetic operations.

#### **One's Complement**
The **1's complement** of a binary number is obtained by inverting all the bits (changing \(0\)s to \(1\)s and \(1\)s to \(0\)s).

**Example:**
Find the 1's complement of \(1010_2\):
\[
1010_2 \rightarrow 0101_2
\]

#### **Two's Complement**
The **2's complement** is obtained by adding \(1\) to the 1's complement of a binary number. This method is widely used to represent negative numbers in computers.

**Steps to Calculate 2's Complement:**
1. **Convert** the absolute value of the number to binary.
2. **Prefix with 0** if the number is positive; prefix with 1 if the number is negative.
3. **Calculate 1's complement** of the binary number.
4. **Add 1** to the 1's complement.

#### **Two's Complement Example for -10**

1. **Convert to Binary:**
   \(10_{10} = 1010_2\).

2. **Prefix with 0:** 
   Add a leading \(0\) for a positive number (e.g., \(01010_2\)). Since we are converting \(-10\), the MSB (most significant bit) will ultimately become \(1\) after complementing to indicate a negative number.

3. **Calculate 1's Complement:**
   \[
   \text{1's complement of } 01010_2 = 10101_2
   \]

4. **Add 1 to 1's Complement:**
   \[
   10101_2 + 1_2 = 10110_2
   \]

Thus, \((-10)_{10} = (10110)_2\) in 5-bit 2's complement representation.

---

#### **Interpretation of MSB**
- The **MSB** is used to determine the sign of the number in 2's complement representation:
  - **0:** Positive number.
  - **1:** Negative number.

---

### Verification of Two's Complement
To verify the representation of \((-10)_{10}\) as \(10110_2\):

1. **Invert the Sign:**
   Find the 2's complement of \(10110_2\) to convert it back to \(10\):
   - 1's complement of \(10110_2 = 01001_2\).
   - Add \(1\): \(01001_2 + 1_2 = 01010_2\).
   - \(01010_2 = 10_{10}\), confirming the representation is correct.

---

### Key Points to Remember
1. **1's Complement**:
   - Flip all bits.
   - Used as an intermediate step for 2's complement.

2. **2's Complement**:
   - Flip all bits (1's complement) and add 1.
   - Allows for straightforward arithmetic operations with signed numbers.
   - MSB determines the sign (0 for positive, 1 for negative).

3. **Applications**:
   - Widely used in digital systems and computing for signed number representation.
