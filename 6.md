# **Binary Number System and Complements**

---

## **Number Systems Overview**

- **Decimal (Base 10):** Uses digits \(0–9\) (10 symbols). This is the system humans commonly use.
- **Binary (Base 2):** Uses digits \(0\) and \(1\). Used in digital electronics and computer systems.
- **Octal (Base 8):** Uses digits \(0–7\). Often used as shorthand for binary.
- **Hexadecimal (Base 16):** Uses digits \(0–9\) and letters \(A–F\) (16 symbols). Widely used for memory addressing and color codes.

---

## **Conversions**

### **1. Binary to Decimal**
To convert a binary number to decimal, use the formula:
\[
\text{Decimal} = \sum_{i=0}^{n-1} (\text{bit}_i \times 2^i)
\]
Where:
- \(i\) is the position of the bit from the right (starting at 0).
- \(\text{bit}_i\) is the \(i\)-th binary digit.

**Example:**
Convert \((1010)_2\) to decimal:
\[
(1010)_2 = (1 \times 2^3) + (0 \times 2^2) + (1 \times 2^1) + (0 \times 2^0)
\]
\[
= 8 + 0 + 2 + 0 = 10_{10}
\]

---

### **2. Decimal to Binary**
To convert a decimal number to binary:
1. Repeatedly divide the number by \(2\).
2. Record the remainders.
3. Read the remainders from bottom to top.

**Example:**
Convert \(13_{10}\) to binary:
1. \(13 \div 2 = 6\), remainder \(1\)
2. \(6 \div 2 = 3\), remainder \(0\)
3. \(3 \div 2 = 1\), remainder \(1\)
4. \(1 \div 2 = 0\), remainder \(1\)

\[
\therefore 13_{10} = 1101_2
\]

---

## **Complements**

### **1. One's Complement**
The **1's complement** of a binary number is obtained by flipping all the bits:
- Change \(0 \to 1\).
- Change \(1 \to 0\).

**Example:**
Find the 1's complement of \((1010)_2\):
\[
1010_2 \to 0101_2
\]

---

### **2. Two's Complement**
The **2's complement** is calculated by:
1. Taking the **1's complement** of the number.
2. Adding \(1\) to the result.

#### **Steps for Calculating Two's Complement**:
1. **Convert the absolute value of the number to binary.**
2. **If negative**, calculate the 1's complement of the binary number.
3. **Add 1** to the result.

---

### **Two's Complement Example for -10**

#### Step-by-Step:
1. **Convert \(10_{10}\) to binary:**
   \[
   10_{10} = 1010_2
   \]

2. **Calculate 1's complement:**
   \[
   \text{1's complement of } 1010_2 = 0101_2
   \]

3. **Add 1 to the 1's complement:**
   \[
   0101_2 + 1_2 = 0110_2
   \]

Thus, \((-10)_{10} = (10110)_2\) in **5-bit 2's complement representation**.

---

### **MSB and Sign in Two's Complement**
- In **two's complement**, the **most significant bit (MSB)** represents the sign:
  - **0**: Positive number.
  - **1**: Negative number.
  
For example:
- \(01010_2 = 10_{10}\) (positive, MSB = 0).
- \(10110_2 = -10_{10}\) (negative, MSB = 1).

---

## **Verification of Two's Complement**

To verify that \((-10)_{10} = 10110_2\):
1. **Find the 2's complement of \(10110_2\) to convert it back to \(10_{10}\):**
   - 1's complement of \(10110_2 = 01001_2\).
   - Add \(1\): \(01001_2 + 1_2 = 01010_2\).
   - \(01010_2 = 10_{10}\).

This confirms the representation is correct.

---

## **Key Properties of Complements**

### **One's Complement**
- Flip all bits (\(0 \leftrightarrow 1\)).
- Used as an intermediate step in 2's complement.

### **Two's Complement**
- Flip all bits (1's complement) and add \(1\).
- Simplifies signed arithmetic in binary systems.
- The MSB indicates the sign.

### **Applications**
- Complements are widely used in:
  - Signed number representation.
  - Arithmetic operations in digital systems.
  - Efficient subtraction (using addition of complements).

---

### **Quick Tips for Two's Complement**
1. Positive numbers remain the same in 2's complement.
2. Negative numbers are represented using the formula:
   \[
   \text{2's complement} = \text{1's complement} + 1
   \]
3. To negate a number in 2's complement, repeat the process:
   - Find the 1's complement.
   - Add \(1\).
