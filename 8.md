# Array Data Structure - Part 1

## Introduction to Arrays

### What is a Data Structure?
A **data structure** is a way to organize and store data in a computer so it can be accessed and used efficiently. Data structures are essential for building real-life systems like websites, apps, and software because they allow developers to handle and process data effectively.

### Why Learn Data Structures?
Data is the fuel of development and coding. Understanding how to handle, manipulate, and store data is fundamental for building scalable and efficient applications.

### Types of Data Structures
1. **Linear Data Structures**: Data elements are arranged in a sequence. Example: Arrays, Linked Lists, Stacks, Queues.
2. **Hierarchical Data Structures**: Data elements are arranged in a hierarchical relationship. Example: Trees, Graphs.

### What is an Array?
An **array** is a linear data structure that:
- Stores multiple elements of the **same data type**.
- Allocates a **contiguous block of memory** for storage.
- Provides **indexed access** to its elements (starting at index `0`).

### Array Syntax
#### Declaration and Initialization:
```cpp
int marks[5] = {56, 36, 78, 99, 87};
```
Here:
- `marks` is an array of size 5 that stores integers.
- Elements are stored contiguously in memory.

#### Accessing Elements:
Elements in an array are accessed using their **index**:
```cpp
marks[0]; // Accesses the first element (56)
marks[3]; // Accesses the fourth element (99)
```

## Operations on Arrays

### Iterating Through Arrays
You can iterate over an array using loops (e.g., `for`, `while`). Example:
```cpp
for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
    cout << marks[i] << " ";
}
```

### Finding the Smallest or Largest Element
To find the smallest or largest element in an array:
```cpp
int smallest = nums[0];
for (int i = 1; i < size; i++) {
    if (nums[i] < smallest) {
        smallest = nums[i];
    }
}
```
**Homework:** Write a program to find the index of the smallest and largest element in an array.

### Pass by Reference
Passing arrays to functions is done by reference, meaning changes in the function affect the original array.
Example:
```cpp
void modifyArray(int arr[], int size) {
    arr[0] = 99; // Modifies the first element
}
```

## Key Array Algorithms

### Linear Search
Linear search is a simple algorithm to find the index of a target element by iterating through the array.

**Algorithm:**
1. Traverse the array from the first to the last element.
2. Compare each element with the target.
3. Return the index if the target is found; otherwise, return `-1`.

**Code:**
```cpp
int linearSearch(int arr[], int size, int target) {
    for (int i = 0; i < size; i++) {
        if (arr[i] == target) {
            return i; // Target found at index i
        }
    }
    return -1; // Target not found
}
```
**Time Complexity:**
- **Best case:** O(1) (target is at the first index).
- **Worst case:** O(n) (target is not in the array).

### Reversing an Array
Reversing an array can be done efficiently using the **two-pointer approach**:

**Algorithm:**
1. Initialize two pointers: `start` at the beginning and `end` at the last index.
2. Swap the elements at `start` and `end`.
3. Increment `start` and decrement `end`.
4. Repeat until `start >= end`.

**Code:**
```cpp
void reverseArray(int arr[], int size) {
    int start = 0, end = size - 1;
    while (start < end) {
        swap(arr[start], arr[end]);
        start++;
        end--;
    }
}
```
**Example:**
- Input: `{1, 2, 3, 4, 5}`
- Output: `{5, 4, 3, 2, 1}`

## Homework
1. Find the index of the largest and smallest numbers in an array.
2. Implement the reverse array function and test it with various inputs.

## Next Steps
- Deep dive into **multi-dimensional arrays**.
- Explore **sorting algorithms** (e.g., Bubble Sort, Selection Sort).
- Learn about **dynamic arrays** for flexible storage.

## Homework problems
- WAF to calculate sum & product of all numbers in an array
- WAF to swap the max & min number of an array 
- WAF to print all the unique values in an array
- WAF to print intersection of 2 arrays
